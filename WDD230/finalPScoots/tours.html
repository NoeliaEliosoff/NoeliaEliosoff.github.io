            <h2>Brief history of Cozumel</h2>

            <img src="images/cozumelSign.jpg" alt="A picture showing a sign with the word 'Cozumel', and a cruise in the back.">

            <p>
                Originally, the Mayans were established in Guatemala, fifteen centuries before Christ. Their culture and influence then extended to the entire south: Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. In 200 ac, they began to build cities in the Yucatan Peninsula.
                <br> The advanced Mayan culture hit its peak from the VII century until the IX century. They considered Cozumel to be a sacred sanctuary and called it “Cuzaam Luumi” which means land or place of the swallows. They later shortened these
                two words to “Cuzamil”. When the Spanish arrived, the name adapted phonetically from “Cuzamil” to “Cozumel”.

            <p>The San Gervasio ruins have a history which dates back to 100 BC and extends through to the 16th century. This is around the time when the Maya are first thought to have settled in Cozumel. Ancient Classic Olmec artefacts have also been found
                in more recent archaeological excavations. It is believed that Cozumel Island was a site sacred to the Ix Chel (Mayan for “She of the rainbows”), the Mayan moon goddess, said to be the deity of midwifery, fertility, medicine and weaving.
                In the past, many women, from mainland Mayan settlements, made a pilgrimage here to Ix Chel’s shrine in order to receive spiritual healing and be blessed with and in childbirth. Today, you can pay a tribute of your own by taking a brief
                tour of this ruin; it costs $9.50 to access the park. Most grumble about the cost of admission, but previous guests do recommend you take some time to visit San Gervasio if you have never seen Mayan ruins up close. <br> If you want to
