            <h2>Site Name:</h2>
            <p>The site name will be theweathercircle.com, I've checked the domain, and it's available. This is going to be more than just a weather site, as the name states it is a community talking about weather in their community, but it would be a space
                to share anything they want about the place where they live.</p>
            <h2>Purpose:</h2>
            <p>The site's main purpose is to join people of the same community, so that they have a place to share things they have in common, tips, concerns. Another important person woould be to share things about the community to people who may want to
                move or visit. This way people could answer questions such us how is the weather usually like during a specific season, or what events took place there, by visiting this site.</p>
