            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>The site is intended to be appealing for people of a wide age range. People of different ages would probably visit the site for different purposes, but we would like to have enough information for any of them to feel good about the site's
                content. It could be a teenager who is in town and would like to know if there are any fun events to attend to, or it could be an old couple who are planning a trip to town and would like to know what people from there say about the weather
                during the season they are planning to go there.
            </p>
