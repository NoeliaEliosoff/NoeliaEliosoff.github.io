        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This webpage's purpose is to simplify your meal preparation. Here you are going to find ideas about what to cook each day of the week; <br> you can set your preferences and the ideas will be customized, and my favorite feature, you will be able
            to input which ingredients <br> you have in your fridge and the computer will do the magic to tell you different options to cook with those!</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>

            meals, or someone who doesn't know what to prepare with <br> the ingredients available at home. </p>
