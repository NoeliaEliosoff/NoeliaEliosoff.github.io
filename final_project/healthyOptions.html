                <h3>Kale </h3>
                <p>Kale contains fiber, antioxidants, calcium, vitamins C and K, iron, and a wide range of other nutrients that can help prevent various health problems. <br> Antioxidants help the body remove unwanted toxins that result from natural processes
                    and environmental pressures. <br> Kale is a crisp and hearty vegetable, with a hint of earthiness. The flavors and nutritional content can vary between types. Younger leaves and summer leaves tend to be less bitter and fibrous. <br>
                    <br> <strong>Cooking Ideas</strong> <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Raw:</strong> Scrunching the leaves briefly in the hands can make them easier to digest. Add to salads, sandwiches, or wraps.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Kale chips:</strong> Remove the ribs from the kale and toss in olive oil or lightly spray and sprinkle with a combination of cumin, curry powder, chili powder, roasted red pepper flakes or garlic powder. Bake at 275°F for
                            15–30 minutes to desired crispness.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Smoothies:</strong> Add a handful of kale to any favorite smoothie. It will add nutrients without changing the flavor very much.</li>

                <h3>Quinoa</h3>
                <p>
                    Quinoa is high in proteins that offer a wide range of amino acids. Amino acids are necessary for supporting muscle development and immune activity, among other essential functions. This makes quinoa an excellent dietary choice for people following a vegetarian
                    or vegan diet. <br> Quinoa is also a great source of magnesium, manganese, and iron. These are also important nutrients for a balanced diet.

                    <strong>Cooking Ideas</strong>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Replace Rice:</strong> You can use quinoa instead of rice in any of your recipies. It cooks to tender in as little as 15 minutes.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Baking & Breakfast:</strong> This grain has a nutty taste that makes it very versatile. It can play a role in baking or as a breakfast grain. <br> Try it!</li>
                        <li> <strong>Salads:</strong> It is also a great idea to add some cooked quinoa to any of your salads, it is going to add nutritional value and, at the same time, it is going to improve its flavor.</li>

                <h3>Blueberries</h3>
                <p>Blackberries contain a high level of vitamin C. <br> Humans are unable to synthesize their own vitamin C, so it is essential to include it as part of a healthy diet. <br> Blackberries also contain vitamin A, which serves several functions
                    in the body. <br> Vitamin A supports the immune system, which combats infections and illness. <br> It also supports the growth and maintenance of teeth and bones, as well as keeping skin healthy. <br>

                    <br>
                    <strong>Cooking Ideas</strong>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Fruit Salad:</strong> Include them as part of a fruit salad with yogurt. You can also add blackberries to cereals, including porridge.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Desserts:</strong> You can make delicious desserts with them, such as apple and blackberry pie or crumble. However, often contain high levels of sugar, which may detract from some of their health benefits.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Smoothies:</strong> Blackberries work well in smoothies with other berries, such as blueberries or raspberries, or with apples. <br> Adding protein powder and oats can increase the nutritional content and help a person
                            feel fuller for longer.</li>
